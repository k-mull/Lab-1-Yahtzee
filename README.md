Yahtzee is a popular dice rolling game. The players roll 5 dice and try to create combination to score the most points. The goal is to get the highest total score by filling out a scorecard. This program allows the user to play a very simplified game of (only 6 round) yahtzee with the user as the only player. The user will be asked which dice they'd like to reroll, but they are also given the option to keep. Then the user will be asked to score a category after 3 turns where. When each category has been chosen the program will display the total score which is the sum of each category.
